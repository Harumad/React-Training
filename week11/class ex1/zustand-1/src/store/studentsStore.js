// We are creating a GLOBAL store.
// This store replaces local state (useState) that was previously in App.jsx.
const useStuedentsStore = create((set) => ({

  // 🆕 NEW (GLOBAL STATE):
  // This replaces: const [students, setStudents] = useState([]);
  // It holds all students globally so any component can access it.
  students: [
    
  ],





  // 🆕 NEW (STORE ACTION):
  // This function replaces setStudents(prev => [...prev, student])
  // It is used to ADD a new student to the global store.
  addStudents: (student) =>
    // 🔁 SAME UPDATE PATTERN AS BEFORE:
    // "state" here is the current global state (like prevStudents)
    set((state) => ({
      // 🔁 SAME LOGIC AS LOCAL STATE:
      // We copy the existing students array
      // and add the new student at the end
      students: [...state.students, { ...student, id: uuidv4() }],
    })), 

  // 🆕 NEW (STORE ACTION — DELETE):
  // This function replaces the delete logic we had in StudentsList
  // It receives ONLY the student id and removes that student
  deleteStudent: (id) =>
    set((state) => ({
      // 🔁 SAME DELETE LOGIC AS LOCAL STATE:

        (student) => student.id !== id
      ),

  // 🆕 NEW (STORE ACTION — UPDATE):
  // This function replaces the update logic we had in StudentsList
  // It receives:
  // 1. the student id
  // 2. the updated data (name, course)
  updateStudent: (id, updatedData) =>
    set((state) => ({
      // 🔁 SAME UPDATE LOGIC AS LOCAL STATE:
      // map loops through all students
      // if id matches → update
      // else → return student unchanged
      students: state.students.map((student) =>
        student.id === id

// 🆕 EXPORTING THE STORE:
// This allows any component to access or update students using this hook.
export default useStuedentsStore;
